# Data Transfer Pipeline: PostgreSQL to MySQL

## Overview

#### This README describes a data transfer pipeline designed to move data from a PostgreSQL database to a MySQL database. The pipeline utilizes Apache Beam, a distributed data processing framework, to extract data from PostgreSQL and insert it into MySQL. By orchestrating this process, the pipeline enables seamless migration or synchronization of data between different database systems.
